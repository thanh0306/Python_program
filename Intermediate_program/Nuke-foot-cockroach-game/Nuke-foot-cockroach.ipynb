    "## 1. Nuke-foot-cockroach-basic\n",
    "- Develop a simple game called nuke-foot-cockroach, which is pretty similar to the more popular variant, paper-rock-scissors. The rules are simple: both players select either nuke, foot or cockroach, and the winner is determined in the following way: Foot beats cockroach, nuke beats foot and cockroach beats nuke. If both the player and the AI select the same, it's a tie, except if both choose nuke, then both lose.\n",
    "- If the player wins, print \"You WIN!\", if they loose \"You LOSE!\". If the round was a tie, either \"It is a tie!\" or \"Both LOSE!\", depending on if the tie was caused by a nuke or not. If the player selects \"quit\", the game ends and the final score is given."
